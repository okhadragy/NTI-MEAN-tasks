# Course Management API

This is a simple RESTful API built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** (via Mongoose) to manage courses and instructors.

---

## 🧠 Entity Chosen: `Course`

### Why `Course`?
The `Course` entity was chosen because it represents a practical real-world use case in educational platforms. Each course includes:
- Title
- Description
- Duration
- Curriculum (structured by week and sessions)
- Instructor (linked via user ID)
- Pricing
- Type (e.g., live, recorded)
- Recording links and other metadata

This makes it perfect for practicing database modeling and CRUD operations.
